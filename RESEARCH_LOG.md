# Research Log — Incidence Theory Lean formalization

Working log for a recurring, self-paced research loop advancing the
Lean 4 formalization's maturity: hypothesize → formalize → prove →
verify → record → next hypothesis. Each entry should be self-contained
enough that a fresh iteration (no memory of prior sessions) can read
this file plus the repo state and continue.

Ground rules carried over from PR #2/#3 discussion, still binding:
- No `sorry`, no vacuous `true := trivial` dressed up as a real theorem.
  If a hypothesis turns out false or unprovable as stated, say so and
  restate honestly (with an explicit hypothesis, or drop it) rather than
  faking it.
- `#print axioms` every new theorem before recording it as done; flag
  anything beyond `propext`/`Classical.choice`/`Quot.sound`.
- Prefer small, concrete, provable-today increments over restating the
  big vision (Inc ⊇ ZFC/ETCS/type theory) as a goal — that requires new
  axioms this repo doesn't have yet and isn't a 30-minute task.
- `rm -rf .lake/build && lake build` clean, then `lake exe
  incidence-theory`, before recording a cycle as verified.

## Status

- PR #2 (`fix/lean-proofs-actually-compile`): base fixes, CI green, open.
- PR #3 (`feat/peano-naturals-in-inc`, based on main): Peano naturals as
  a concrete `Incidence` instance, CI green, open.

## Cycle 1

**Hypothesis**: the `GluingSpec` abstraction (already exercised once, by
`triGluingSpec` on the triangle graph's ad hoc left-biased, non-commutative
`glue`) also fits a genuinely different kind of instance — a commutative
monoid — without needing to change `GluingSpec` itself. If so, that's a
real (if modest) generality signal: one instance could be a fluke that
happens to fit; two structurally unrelated instances is evidence the
abstraction is doing real work.

**Method**: prove `natIncidence.glue` (`= Nat.add`) is commutative, and
construct `natGluingSpec : GluingSpec natIncidence` (unit/associativity/
type-preservation obligations), reusing the *same* `GluingSpec` structure
`triGluingSpec` uses.

**Result**: confirmed. `natIncidence_glue_comm` and `natGluingSpec` both
compile with only `propext`/`Classical.choice`/`Quot.sound` — no
`sorryAx`, no widening of `GluingSpec` itself needed. Added to
`IncidenceTheory/Peano.lean` (stacked onto PR #3, unmerged).

**Next hypothesis (cycle 2, not yet attempted)**: can Inc's own boundary/
endpoint vocabulary (not a bolted-on Lean structure) encode *ordered
pairs* — i.e., an incidence `p` whose `boundary p` has exactly two
endpoints distinguished by `role` (first/second projection)? This would
be a genuine ZFC-adjacent building block (relations/functions as sets of
pairs) reachable without inventing a full axiom of infinity or
comprehension yet. Concretely: define a `PairRole` (`fst`/`snd`), a
`pairBoundary`, a `pairIncidence`, and prove the projections are
well-defined and jointly injective (`pair a b = pair a' b' → a = a' ∧ b
= b'`) the same way `natIncidence_rel_eq`/faithfulness was proved for
Peano — by induction on the bisimulation witness, not by assumption.

## Cycle 2

**Hypothesis**: (as queued above) ordered pairs encodable via `boundary`
alone, with projections recoverable structurally and pairing jointly
injective, proved the same faithfulness way as Peano's cycle.

**Method**: `PairId := atom (n : Nat) | pair (a b : PairId)`,
`pairBoundary` gives an atom `[]` and a pair its two role-tagged
endpoints, `pairIncidence : Incidence PairId PairRole GraphType`. Then
attempted the Peano-style full faithfulness theorem
(`approxBisim pairIncidence x y ↔ x = y`).

**Result**: partially confirmed, and the *refutation* is itself the
interesting finding — this is what a co-scientist loop is for, not just
banking wins:
- ✅ `pairIncidence` is a valid `Incidence` (all 14 fields).
- ✅ `pairIncidence_pair_injective`: pairing is jointly injective.
- ✅ `pairIncidence_boundary_pair`: projections literally = `boundary`,
  not a separate accessor.
- ❌ Full faithfulness (`≈` ↔ `=`) is **false** for this instance, and
  `pairIncidence_atoms_collapse` proves a concrete counterexample:
  `atom 0 ≈ atom 1` even though `atom 0 ≠ atom 1`. Cause: unlike
  `natIncidence` (where the predecessor chain gives every element a
  unique "distance from zero"), a bare atom's boundary is `[]`
  regardless of *which* atom — nothing in `boundary`/`typeFunc`
  distinguishes `atom 3` from `atom 999`, so the relation "any atom ≈
  any atom, and pairs of related things ≈ each other" is a genuine
  bisimulation. Faithfulness needs distinguishing structure; it is not
  automatic just because an instance "looks well-founded".

Added to `IncidenceTheory/Pairs.lean` (stacked onto PR #3, unmerged).
`#print axioms` on every theorem here: `propext`/`Classical.choice`/
`Quot.sound` only (`pairIncidence_pair_injective` needs no axioms at
all — it's pure `injection` on the carrier type), no `sorryAx`.

**Next hypothesis (cycle 3, not yet attempted)**: fix atom-distinguishability
by giving atoms the same predecessor-chain trick `natIncidence` used —
i.e., index atoms so `boundary (atom (n+1))` points at `atom n` (reusing
`peanoBoundary`'s shape) instead of `[]` uniformly. If that recovers full
`≈ ↔ =` faithfulness for `PairId` built over such atoms, it's evidence
that "give every leaf a canonical predecessor-style boundary" is a
*general* recipe for faithfulness in Inc, not a Peano-specific accident
— worth stating as a lemma (e.g. "any well-founded, boundary-injective
carrier is ≈-faithful") rather than re-deriving per instance.
