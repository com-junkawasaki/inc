# Research Log — Incidence Theory Lean formalization

Working log for a recurring, self-paced research loop advancing the
Lean 4 formalization's maturity: hypothesize → formalize → prove →
verify → record → next hypothesis. Each entry should be self-contained
enough that a fresh iteration (no memory of prior sessions) can read
this file plus the repo state and continue.

Ground rules carried over from PR #2/#3 discussion, still binding:
- No `sorry`, no vacuous `true := trivial` dressed up as a real theorem.
  If a hypothesis turns out false or unprovable as stated, say so and
  restate honestly (with an explicit hypothesis, or drop it) rather than
  faking it.
- `#print axioms` every new theorem before recording it as done; flag
  anything beyond `propext`/`Classical.choice`/`Quot.sound`.
- Prefer small, concrete, provable-today increments over restating the
  big vision (Inc ⊇ ZFC/ETCS/type theory) as a goal — that requires new
  axioms this repo doesn't have yet and isn't a 30-minute task.
- `rm -rf .lake/build && lake build` clean, then `lake exe
  incidence-theory`, before recording a cycle as verified.

## Status

- PR #2 (`fix/lean-proofs-actually-compile`): base fixes, CI green, open.
- PR #3 (`feat/peano-naturals-in-inc`, based on main): Peano naturals as
  a concrete `Incidence` instance, CI green, open.

## Cycle 1

**Hypothesis**: the `GluingSpec` abstraction (already exercised once, by
`triGluingSpec` on the triangle graph's ad hoc left-biased, non-commutative
`glue`) also fits a genuinely different kind of instance — a commutative
monoid — without needing to change `GluingSpec` itself. If so, that's a
real (if modest) generality signal: one instance could be a fluke that
happens to fit; two structurally unrelated instances is evidence the
abstraction is doing real work.

**Method**: prove `natIncidence.glue` (`= Nat.add`) is commutative, and
construct `natGluingSpec : GluingSpec natIncidence` (unit/associativity/
type-preservation obligations), reusing the *same* `GluingSpec` structure
`triGluingSpec` uses.

**Result**: confirmed. `natIncidence_glue_comm` and `natGluingSpec` both
compile with only `propext`/`Classical.choice`/`Quot.sound` — no
`sorryAx`, no widening of `GluingSpec` itself needed. Added to
`IncidenceTheory/Peano.lean` (stacked onto PR #3, unmerged).

**Next hypothesis (cycle 2, not yet attempted)**: can Inc's own boundary/
endpoint vocabulary (not a bolted-on Lean structure) encode *ordered
pairs* — i.e., an incidence `p` whose `boundary p` has exactly two
endpoints distinguished by `role` (first/second projection)? This would
be a genuine ZFC-adjacent building block (relations/functions as sets of
pairs) reachable without inventing a full axiom of infinity or
comprehension yet. Concretely: define a `PairRole` (`fst`/`snd`), a
`pairBoundary`, a `pairIncidence`, and prove the projections are
well-defined and jointly injective (`pair a b = pair a' b' → a = a' ∧ b
= b'`) the same way `natIncidence_rel_eq`/faithfulness was proved for
Peano — by induction on the bisimulation witness, not by assumption.
